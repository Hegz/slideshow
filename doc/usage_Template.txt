Automatic Slide show README

Files in this folder will be displayed to the Hallway computer screen.

There are 3 possible methods to have files displayed to the hallway monitor: 
Automatic OpenOffice.org Slideshow, Automatic Movie file, or mixed document 
slideshow.

Automatic OpenOffice.org Slideshow
----------------------------------

Place a file in this folder called 'MAGICODP' and it will be displayed on the
monitor exacatly as it was designed.  The system will check for changes and/or 
for a new slide show to the every 15 minuites.

This is most useful if you want to just display information such as daily 
announcements or the current block rotation. Just the MAGICODP slide show will 
be shown, even if there are other documents in this folder.


Automatic Movie file
----------------------------------

Place a movie file in this folder called 'MAGICVIDEO' where EXT can be any of:
VIDEOEXTENTIONS.  The file will be played on a loop on the monitor exactly as 
it appears.  The system will check for changes and/or a new movie file every
15 minuites.

Currently this is the only way to show a movie file on the monitor, and only 
one video file can be shown at any give time.  the 'MAGICVIDEO' file will be 
shown unless there is a 'MAGICODP' in this folder.


Mixed Document Slideshow
----------------------------------

Documents ( OpenOffice Impress slide shows. Adobe PDF Documents) as well as 
picture files (jpg, gif, png) will be displayed in a random order to the 
monitor.  The folder will be checked every 15 minuites for updates to the 
Document files.  Pictures files will be updated every minuite.

This is useful to show a slideshow of recent school events, mixed with 
anouncements or other content that would normally be displayed in a OpenOffice
Impress document.  If the file 'MAGICODP' or 'MAGICVIDEO' exist in this folder, 
one of those options will be displayed instead.
